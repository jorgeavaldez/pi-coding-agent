;;; pi-coding-agent-gui-tests.el --- GUI integration tests for pi-coding-agent -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; ERT tests that require a real Emacs GUI (windows, frames, scrolling).
;; Run with: make test-gui
;;
;; These tests focus on behavior that CANNOT be tested with unit tests:
;; - Real window scrolling during LLM streaming
;; - Auto-scroll vs scroll-preservation with actual content
;; - Tool invocation end-to-end
;;
;; Many behaviors (history, spacing, kill-buffer) are covered by unit tests.
